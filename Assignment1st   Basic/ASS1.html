    <p>
        A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain. It often has a distinct summit, and is usually applied to peaks which are above elevation compared to the relative landmass, though not as prominent as mountains. Hills fall under the category of slope landforms.
    </p>

    <p>The distinction between a hill and a mountain is unclear and largely subjective,<u> but a hill is universally considered to be not as tall, or as steep as a mountain.</u></p>
